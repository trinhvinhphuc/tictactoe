# Tic Tac Toe
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe website! Here you can read about the game and download the source code to play it yourself.

## About the Game
Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players. Players take turns marking X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game is a tie.

## How to Play
To play the game, simply download the source code from the GitHub repository and run it on your local machine. The game is designed to be played on the command line.

When you run the game, it will prompt you to enter the IP address and port number of the server you want to connect to. If you are playing with a friend, you will need to coordinate with them to ensure that you are both connecting to the same server.

## Source Code
